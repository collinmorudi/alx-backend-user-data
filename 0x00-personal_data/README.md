## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following without the help of Google:
- Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- How to implement a log filter that will obfuscate PII fields
- How to encrypt a password and check the validity of an input password
- How to authenticate to a database using environment variables

## Requirements
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All your modules should have a documentation.
- All your classes should have a documentation.
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation.
- All your functions should be type annotated.

## Tasks

### 0. Regex-ing
Write a function called `filter_datum` that returns the log message obfuscated

## More info will be added
